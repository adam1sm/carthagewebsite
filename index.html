          <h3>How is Carthage different from platforms like Robinhood and Fidelity?</h3>
          <div class="icon"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Robinhood, Fidelity, and other existing brokerage platforms share Carthage's vision of making the investment process more accessible; everyone should be able to make all sorts of investments. The difference is that we focus specifically on democratizing access to equity in startups and early-stage companies. </p>
         <br>
          <p>If you had invested just $10 into AirBnB during seed funding, far before it could have ever been available on platforms like Fidelity and Robinhood, you'd today have roughly $300,000. At Carthage, we are making these sorts of investments an option for everyone- not just Mark Cuban.

          <h3>What exactly is Reg A+?</h3>
          <div class="icon"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Reg A+ is the SEC regulatory framework that Carthage is being built on. Put simply, it allows startups to raise up to $75M from <em>retail</em> (non-professional) investors through a mini-IPO. </p>

          <br>
          <p> Carthage's vision is strong, but creating a fully liquid market for equity that is so heavily regulated is quite ambitious. We have chosen to build our platform around Reg A+ because it is the only SEC framework that allows retail investors to recieve liquid equity. Carthage will be the first platform to ever use Reg A+ in this way.  </p>

          <h3>How do startups benefit from using Carthage?</h3>
          <div class="icon"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Besides the initial $75M they may gain from retail investors, startups who complete registration with Carthage gain listing on our platform. This grants them access to an incredibly broad audience of investors who <em>will</em> talk about their investments. This can happen every time a trade is made on our market that encourages trading, which perpetuates a cycle of ongoing interest for startups that may as well have registered years before. </p>

          <h3>Will all startups on Carthage succeed?</h3>
          <div class="icon"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>No- in fact, Startup Genome estimates that about 90% of startups fail. This is one reason why startup investments are heavily regulated. Carthage provides tools to give you the choice to make potentially life-changing investments, but outcomes are never guaranteed.</p>
